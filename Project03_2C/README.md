# Project03 - Views and modifiers - Challenge 2

This third SwiftUI project is actually the first technique project, looking at SwiftUI views and view modifiers in depth, how they work in detail along with why they work that way.

Challenge 2 - Go back to project 1 and use a conditional modifier to change the total amount text view to red if the user selects a 0% tip.
