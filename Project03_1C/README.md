# Project03 - Views and modifiers - Challenge 1

This third SwiftUI project is actually the first technique project, looking at SwiftUI views and view modifiers in depth, how they work in detail along with why they work that way.

Challenge 1 - Create a custom ViewModifier (and accompanying View extension) that makes a view have a large, blue font suitable for prominent titles in a view.
