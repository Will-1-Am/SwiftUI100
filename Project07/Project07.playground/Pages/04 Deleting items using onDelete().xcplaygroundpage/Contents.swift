/*
 SwiftUI gives us the onDelete() modifier for us to use to control how objects should be deleted from a collection. In practice, this is almost exclusively used with List and ForEach: we create a list of rows that are shown using ForEach, then attach onDelete() to that ForEach so the user can remove rows they donâ€™t want.
 
 NOTE: This playground page must be run in an Xcode project, otherwise crashey crashey
