# Project07 - iExpense - Challenge 2

iExpense is an expense tracker that separates personal costs from business costs.

Challenge 2 - Modify the expense amounts in ContentView to contain some styling depending on their value â€“ expenses under $10 should have one style, expenses under $100 another, and expenses over $100 a third style. What those styles are depend on you.
