# Project04 - BetterRest

BetterRest uses machine learning and is designed to help coffee drinkers get a good night’s sleep by asking them three questions:

When do they want to wake up?
Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?
Once we have those three values, we’ll feed them into Core ML to get a result telling us when they ought to go to bed.
