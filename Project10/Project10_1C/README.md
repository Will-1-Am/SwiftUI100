# Project10 - Cupcake Corner - Challenge 1

Build a multi-screen app for ordering cupcakes, using forms validation and sending and receiving the order data via the internet.

Challenge 1 - Our address fields are currently considered value if they contain anything, even if itâ€™s just only whitespace. Improve the validation to make sure a string of pure whitespace is invalid.
