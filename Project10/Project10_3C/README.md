# Project10 - Cupcake Corner - Challenge 3

Build a multi-screen app for ordering cupcakes, using forms validation and sending and receiving the order data via the internet.

Challenge 3 - For a more challenging task, see if you can convert our data model from a class to a struct, then create an ObservableObject class wrapper around it that gets passed around. This will result in your class having one @Published property, which is the data struct inside it, and should make supporting Codable on the struct much easier.
