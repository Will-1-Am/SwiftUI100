# Project10 - Cupcake Corner - Challenge 2

Build a multi-screen app for ordering cupcakes, using forms validation and sending and receiving the order data via the internet.

Challenge 2 - If our call to placeOrder() fails – for example if there is no internet connection – show an informative alert for the user. To test this, just disable WiFi on your Mac so the simulator has no connection either.
