     MARK:  While the user can search for an image and select it to dismiss the view, nothing is done with the selection. UIKit uses a system of delegation to act upon a selection and SwiftUI calls this a Coordinator which can also provide additional functionality.  The parent is specified explicitly so that the coordinator knows where to pass any relevant interesting events.  The Coordinator class needs to conform to UINavigationControllerDelegate and UIImagePickerControllerDelegate in order to work with a UIImagePicker.  Coordinator also inherits from the base class of most UIKit types - NSObject.
