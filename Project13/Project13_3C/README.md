# Project13 - Instafilter - Challenge 1

The first of two projects exploring how SwiftUI can connect with other Apple frameworks.  This project builds an app that lets the user import photos from their library, then modify them using various image effects.

Challenge 3 - Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.
