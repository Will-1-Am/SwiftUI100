# Project15 - Accessibility - Challenge 2

Making your app accessible means taking steps to ensure that everyone can use it fully regardless of their individual needs. For example, if they are blind then your app should work well with the systemâ€™s VoiceOver system to ensure your UI can be read smoothly.  This technique project examines a handful of accessibility techniques, then at some of the previous projects to see how they might get upgraded.

Challenge 2 - Fix the steppers in BetterRest so that they read out useful information when the user adjusts their values.
