# Project15 - Accessibility - Challenge 3

Making your app accessible means taking steps to ensure that everyone can use it fully regardless of their individual needs. For example, if they are blind then your app should work well with the system’s VoiceOver system to ensure your UI can be read smoothly.  This technique project examines a handful of accessibility techniques, then at some of the previous projects to see how they might get upgraded.

Challenge 3 - Do a full accessibility review of Moonshot – what changes do you need to make so that it’s fully accessible?
