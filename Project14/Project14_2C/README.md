# Project14 - Bucket List - Challenge 2

Build an app that lets the user build a private list of places on the map that they intend to visit one day, add a description for that place, look up interesting places that are nearby, and save it all to the iOS storage for later.

Challenge 2 - Having a complex if condition in the middle of ContentView isn’t easy to read – can you rewrite it so that the MapView, Circle, and Button are part of their own view? This might take more work than you think!
