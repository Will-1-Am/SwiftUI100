# Project14 - Bucket List - Challenge 1

Build an app that lets the user build a private list of places on the map that they intend to visit one day, add a description for that place, look up interesting places that are nearby, and save it all to the iOS storage for later.

Challenge 1 - Our + button is rather hard to tap. Try moving all its modifiers to the image inside the button â€“ what difference does it make, and can you think why?
