# Project14 - Bucket List - Challenge 3

Build an app that lets the user build a private list of places on the map that they intend to visit one day, add a description for that place, look up interesting places that are nearby, and save it all to the iOS storage for later.

Challenge 3 - Our app silently fails when errors occur during biometric authentication. Add code to show those errors in an alert, but be careful: you can only add one alert() modifier to each view.
