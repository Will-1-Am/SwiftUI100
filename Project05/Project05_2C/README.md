# Project05 - Word Scramble - Challenge 2

The game, Word Scramble, will show players a random eight-letter word, and ask them to make words out of it. For example, if the starter word is “alarming” they might spell “alarm”, “ring”, “main”, and so on.

Challenge 2 - Add a left bar button item that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.
