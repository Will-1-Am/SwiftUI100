# Project05 - Word Scramble - Challenge 3

The game, Word Scramble, will show players a random eight-letter word, and ask them to make words out of it. For example, if the starter word is “alarming” they might spell “alarm”, “ring”, “main”, and so on.

Challenge 3 - Put a text view below the List so you can track and show the player’s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.
