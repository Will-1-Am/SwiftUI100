# Project09 - Drawing - Challenge 1

In this technique project we’re going to take a close look at drawing in SwiftUI, including creating custom paths and shapes, animating your changes, solving performance problems, and more – it’s a really big topic, and deserves close attention.

Challenge 1 - Create an Arrow shape made from a rectangle and a triangle – having it point straight up is fine.
