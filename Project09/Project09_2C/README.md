# Project09 - Drawing - Challenge 2

In this technique project we’re going to take a close look at drawing in SwiftUI, including creating custom paths and shapes, animating your changes, solving performance problems, and more – it’s a really big topic, and deserves close attention.

Challenge  2 - Make the line thickness of your Arrow shape animatable.
