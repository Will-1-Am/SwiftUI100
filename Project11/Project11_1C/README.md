# Project11 - Bookworm - Challenge 1

Build an app to track which books you’ve read and what you thought of them using CoreData, a star rating widget and the @Binding property wrapper.

Challenge 1 - Right now it’s possible to select no genre for books, which causes a problem for the detail view. Please fix this, either by forcing a default, validating the form, or showing a default picture for unknown genres – you can choose.
