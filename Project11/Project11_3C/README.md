# Project11 - Bookworm - Challenge 3

Build a multi-screen app for ordering cupcakes, using forms validation and sending and receiving the order data via the internet.

Challenge 3 - Add a new “date” attribute to the Book entity, assigning Date() to it so it gets the current date and time, then format that nicely somewhere in DetailView.
