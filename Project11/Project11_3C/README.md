# Project11 - Bookworm - Challenge 3

Build an app to track which books you’ve read and what you thought of them using CoreData, a star rating widget and the @Binding property wrapper.

Challenge 3 - Add a new “date” attribute to the Book entity, assigning Date() to it so it gets the current date and time, then format that nicely somewhere in DetailView.
